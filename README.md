# A motivational-based learning model for mobile robots
Humans' behavior is driven by needs and changing preferences, making decision-making complex. To model this for robots, we use Hull's motivation theory, simulating an agent that strives for homeostasis. By incorporating hedonic dimensions and reinforcement learning, we train robots with different energy decay rates in various environments to study how these factors affect their strategies and behavior.

## _Wanting_ mechanism (M1)
Behavior learning occurs from the expected reward resulting from drive reduction.

## _Wanting x Liking_ mechanisms (M2) 
Behavior learning occurs from the expected reward resulting from drive reduction and hedonic dimension.
